    <p>Like so many of the technologies that have changed the world, artificial intelligence (AI) developed over many years before it seemed to suddenly burst on the scene. Today, AI is ubiquitous and offers revolutionary potential for education.

    With AI, educators can tailor learning experiences to individual student needs, making education more effective and engaging. AI-enabled technologies also assist in administrative tasks, streamlining operations and freeing up educators to focus on teaching. Learn more about how teachers and school administrators are using AI-powered tools today and the possibilities for the future of artificial intelligence in education</p>

    <h1>Some ways teachers are using generative AI tools</h1>
    <p>Teachers are finding many different ways to use AI capabilities to enhance learning outcomes. Two notable applications include creating visual aids for vocabulary instruction and planning engaging math lessons.</p>
    
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Support for vocabulary instruction</h3>
    <p>An instructional designer has helped teachers create visuals for many different grade levels and subjects using AI. Her tips for doing so include :</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>Identify challenging vocabulary words for upcoming lessons</li>
      <li>Choose an AI tool that fits your needs and is easy to access</li>
      <li>Craft specific prompts to generate images that illustrate vocabulary words</li>
      <li>Share and credit the AI-generated images with students to introduce the concept of AI</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Math lesson planning using artificial intelligence</h3>
    <p>
      The author, a high school math teacher and instructional coach, explains how to use generative AI to assist teachers in planning engaging math lessons. Her steps include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use AI to connect math topics to real-world applications and student interests</li>
      <li>Generate word problems, performance tasks, and projects that align with curriculum standards</li>
      <li>Design comprehensive lesson plans with essential questions, practice problems, and extension opportunities</li>
      <li>Use AI to create inquiry-based activities that develop critical thinking and quantitative literacy skills </li>
    </ul>

    <p>AI is transforming education through personalized learning, automation, and smart tutoring systems.</p>
